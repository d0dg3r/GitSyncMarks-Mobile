GitSyncMarks-App — sync your bookmarks from your GitHub repo on your phone or tablet.

**Why GitSyncMarks-App?**
Your bookmarks live in your Git repo. This app is the mobile companion to the GitSyncMarks browser extension (Chrome, Firefox). Uses the same per-file format — sync once, browse offline. Move, reorder, and add bookmarks; sync settings between devices.

**Features:**
• Sync from GitHub via Contents API
• Move bookmarks — long-press to move into folders (including subfolders)
• Reorder bookmarks — drag-and-drop in any folder
• Share link as bookmark — receive URLs from your browser
• Settings Sync to Git — extension-compatible encrypted sync (Global/Individual)
• Local cache — bookmarks load from cache on app start (offline)
• GitHub Personal Access Token — secure, repo scope
• Folder selection — toolbar, menu, mobile, other
• Favicons via DuckDuckGo
• Pull-to-refresh
• Light and dark mode (system theme)
• German, English, Spanish, French

**Setup:**
1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with repo scope
2. Enter token, repository owner, and name in Settings
3. Set branch (main) and base path (bookmarks)
4. Tap Sync to fetch your bookmarks

**Requirements:**
A GitSyncMarks-compatible repository. See github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks for the format.
