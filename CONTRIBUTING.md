## Flatpak Test Workflow

To test the Flatpak build without running the full release (Windows, macOS, release job):

- **Manual:** Go to Actions → "Flatpak test" → Run workflow
- **Tag:** Push `v0.3.0-flatpak-test.1` (or any `v*-flatpak-test*` tag)

Downloads only `build-android-linux` and `build-flatpak`. The `.flatpak` artifact is available from the workflow run.
