# GitSyncMarks-App – Project Context

When starting or resuming work on this project, especially in a new IDE session:

1. **Read [docs/CONTEXT.md](docs/CONTEXT.md)** – Origin, decisions, POC status
2. **Read [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md)** – Implementation phases, next steps
3. **Read [docs/BOOKMARK-FORMAT.md](docs/BOOKMARK-FORMAT.md)** – Bookmark JSON structure, GitHub API

This is a Flutter app (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux) that syncs bookmarks from a GitHub repo (GitSyncMarks format), opens URLs in the user's browser, and supports move/reorder/delete/add (synced to repo). Android stable; other platforms alpha.

**Parent project:** https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks (browser extension)

**Workflow:** Test locally, ask before commit, small steps (see User Rules). For releases: [release-workflow.mdc](release-workflow.mdc). For platform code: [platform-gotchas.mdc](platform-gotchas.mdc).
