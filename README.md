![GitSyncMarks](store/banner_logo.png)

Cross-platform app (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux) that syncs bookmarks from your GitHub repo and opens URLs in your preferred browser.  
Companion to the [GitSyncMarks](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks) browser extension. Supports move, reorder, add via share (mobile), and encrypted settings sync.



**Why GitSyncMarks-App?** View your [GitSyncMarks](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks) bookmarks on mobile. Uses the same per-file format — bookmarks live in *your* Git repo. Sync once, browse offline. Works with the browser extension's bookmark structure (toolbar, menu, other, mobile).



See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for milestones and future plans.

## Beta testing (Google Play)

We're looking for beta testers before the public Google Play Store launch.



## Installation

### Android

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks-App/releases)
2. Download `GitSyncMarks-App-X.X.X.apk` (or a pre-release build for testing)
3. Open the file on your Android device (allow from unknown sources if prompted)
4. Install the app

### Linux (Flatpak, recommended)

1. Download `GitSyncMarks-App-vX.X.X.flatpak` from [Releases](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks-App/releases)
2. Install:
  ```bash
   flatpak install --user ./GitSyncMarks-App-vX.X.X.flatpak
  ```
3. Run:
  ```bash
   flatpak run io.github.d0dg3r.GitSyncMarksApp
  ```

### Linux (ZIP fallback)

1. Download `GitSyncMarks-App-X.X.X-linux-x64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks-App/releases)
2. Extract and run:
  ```bash
   unzip GitSyncMarks-App-X.X.X-linux-x64.zip -d GitSyncMarks-App
   cd GitSyncMarks-App
   ./gitsyncmarks_app
  ```

### Windows / macOS

Download the respective `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks-App/releases), extract, and run the executable.

### Configure the app

1. Open the app and go to **Settings** (first tab)
2. Enter your **Personal Access Token** (create one at [GitHub Settings > Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=GitSyncMarks+Sync) with `repo` scope)
3. Enter **Repository Owner** and **Repository Name** (your bookmark repo)
4. Set **Branch** (usually `main`) and **Base Path** (default `bookmarks` — must match your [GitSyncMarks](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks) extension config)
5. Select which folders to display (toolbar, menu, other, mobile)
6. Click **Test Connection** to verify, then **Save**
7. Use **Sync Bookmarks** to fetch your bookmarks

## Project References

The bookmark format comes from [GitSyncMarks](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks). Your repo should use folders like `toolbar`, `menu`, `other`, `mobile` with JSON files per bookmark. The app supports moving, reordering, and adding bookmarks. Settings can be synced encrypted (extension-compatible). For full bidirectional sync, use the [browser extension](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks).

## Prerequisites (Development)

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (3.41.0 or later)

## Setup (Development)

1. **Install Flutter**:
  ```bash
   # Arch Linux / CachyOS
   paru -S flutter
   # or: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
  ```
2. **Get dependencies**:
  ```bash
   cd GitSyncMarks-App
   flutter pub get
  ```
3. **Run on device/emulator**:
  ```bash
   flutter run -d android
   flutter run -d linux      # Linux desktop
   flutter run -d windows    # Windows (on Windows host)
   flutter run -d macos     # macOS (on macOS host)
  ```
4. **Build standalone executable** (no Flutter runtime needed):
  ```bash
   flutter build linux      # → build/linux/x64/release/bundle/
   flutter build windows    # → build/windows/x64/runner/Release/ (Windows host only)
   flutter build macos     # → build/macos/Build/Products/Release/ (macOS host only)
  ```
5. **Regenerate screenshots** (optional, vor Release):
  ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-screenshots.sh
  ```

## Releases

Releases are built automatically on tag push (`v*`). All tags trigger builds for all platforms.

```bash
# Stable release (marked as "latest")
git tag v0.3.0 && git push origin v0.3.0

# Pre-release (visible under Releases, but not marked as "latest")
git tag v0.3.0-beta.1 && git push origin v0.3.0-beta.1
```

**Tag convention:**

- `v1.2.3` — stable release, marked as "latest"
- `v1.2.3-beta.1`, `v1.2.3-rc.1`, `v1.2.3-test.1` — pre-release (any tag with `-` suffix)

Artifacts appear under [Releases](https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks-App/releases): APK (Android), Flatpak + ZIP (Linux), ZIP (Windows, macOS).

### Flatpak-only test

To test the Flatpak build without running the full release workflow (Windows, macOS, release job):

- **Manual**: Go to Actions → "Flatpak test" → Run workflow
- **Tag**: Push `v0.3.0-flatpak-test.1` (or any `v*-flatpak-test`* tag)

This runs only `build-android-linux` and `build-flatpak`. The `.flatpak` artifact can be downloaded from the workflow run.

## Platform Status


| Platform | Status     | Notes                                                             |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android  | **Stable** | Primary platform, actively developed                              |
| Windows  | Alpha      | Built from same codebase, developed as time permits               |
| Linux    | Alpha      | Flatpak + ZIP; developed as time permits                          |
| macOS    | Alpha      | Built from same codebase, developed as time permits               |
| iOS      | Alpha      | Built from same codebase; no CI build yet (requires macOS runner) |


Android is the main focus. All other platforms share the same Flutter codebase and are maintained on a best-effort basis -- contributions welcome!
