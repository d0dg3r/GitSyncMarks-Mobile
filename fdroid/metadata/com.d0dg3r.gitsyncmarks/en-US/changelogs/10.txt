Version 0.3.3: Settings Sync now uses extension-compatible profiles paths (`profiles/<alias>/settings.enc`) with improved client-name flow and legacy read fallback. Added custom sync interval input, sync profile guidance, and last synced commit hash in status. GitHub settings now include a dedicated Folders tab and hidden internal profiles folder. General settings now support app language + theme selection with full 12-language localization parity.
