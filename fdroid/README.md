# F-Droid Submission

This folder contains metadata for submitting GitSyncMarks-App to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).

## Listing status (paused)

**The app is not published on F-Droid at the moment.** The previous **fdroiddata** merge request was **closed**; we are **not** maintaining an active submission until a later retry. The YAML, changelogs, and scripts here stay in the repo so a future resubmit does not start from zero. When you open a new MR, refresh `commit:` / versions with the release you intend to ship and run the usual repro + validate flow (`./fdroid/submit-to-gitlab.sh` from the repo root).

## Release workflow (correct order)

1. **Release commit:** Version bump in `pubspec.yaml`, `CHANGELOG.md`, docs, `fdroid/metadata/...` `versionName` / `versionCode` / `CurrentVersion*`, new `en-US/changelogs/{versionCode}.txt`, then `git commit`.
2. **F-Droid build commit:** From repo root, run `./scripts/finish-release-fdroid-commit.sh` — sets every `    commit:` in [com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks-fdroid-submit.yml](metadata/com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks-fdroid-submit.yml) and [com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks.yml](metadata/com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks.yml) to the **first** (release) commit hash, then creates a small follow-up commit. Use `./scripts/finish-release-fdroid-commit.sh --tag` to also create `vX.Y.Z` pointing at that release commit.
3. **Push** branch (and tag): `git push origin main` and `git push origin vX.Y.Z` (or push your release branch + tag as per your workflow).
4. **Wait for Build & Release to finish green** and verify the GitHub release APK exists for `vX.Y.Z`.
5. **Submit metadata checks:** In [com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks-fdroid-submit.yml](metadata/com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks-fdroid-submit.yml): single current stable build block with `binary:`; keep `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`. No comments in YAML (rewritemeta fails).
6. **Verify tag/commit:** `git rev-parse vX.Y.Z^{commit}` (or a lightweight tag) must equal `commit:` in the submit YAML (`./fdroid/submit-to-gitlab.sh` enforces this).
7. **Run reproducibility proof:** `bash scripts/fdroid-repro-proof.sh` must pass (`libapp.so` hash match).
8. **Submit:** `./fdroid/submit-to-gitlab.sh` from project root.

The tag must exist before submitting. Use the **full commit hash** in `commit:` (not the tag name) – F-Droid's shallow clone may not fetch tags. Get it with `git rev-parse vX.Y.Z^{commit}` (annotated tags) or `git rev-parse vX.Y.Z` (lightweight tags).

## Android-only CI run (manual)

When you want to debug only the Android container build, run `Build & Release` manually in `android-only` mode. This starts only `build-android` and skips Linux/macOS/Windows/Flatpak and release aggregation jobs.

```bash
gh workflow run "Build & Release" -f build_scope=android-only
gh run list --workflow "Build & Release" --limit 5
```

## Do this, then this (copy/paste)

### Stable release

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
# After your release commit is on main:
./scripts/finish-release-fdroid-commit.sh --tag   # metadata + optional tag on release commit
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
bash scripts/fdroid-repro-proof.sh
./fdroid/submit-to-gitlab.sh --validate-only
./fdroid/submit-to-gitlab.sh YOUR_GITLAB_USER
```

### Recovery if tag was wrong

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

After retagging, update `commit:` in submit metadata to `git rev-parse vX.Y.Z`, then run:

```bash
bash scripts/fdroid-repro-proof.sh
./fdroid/submit-to-gitlab.sh --validate-only
./fdroid/submit-to-gitlab.sh YOUR_GITLAB_USER
```

## One-command submission (GitLab + SSH)

1. Fork [fdroiddata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata) on GitLab (once)
2. Run from the project root:

   ```bash
   chmod +x fdroid/submit-to-gitlab.sh
   ./fdroid/submit-to-gitlab.sh YOUR_GITLAB_USER
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_GITLAB_USER` with your GitLab username (e.g. `d0dg3r`). Use `--force` to overwrite the remote branch (e.g. when updating and MR has no review changes to keep).

3. Open the MR link printed at the end, or go to [New Merge Request](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/new) and select branch `com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks` from your fork.

## Manual submission

1. Fork [fdroiddata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata) on GitLab
2. Clone your fork, create branch:

   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 git@gitlab.com:YOUR_USER/fdroiddata ~/fdroiddata
   cd ~/fdroiddata
   git checkout -b com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks
   ```

3. Copy metadata: `cp /path/to/GitSyncMarks-App/fdroid/metadata/com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks-fdroid-submit.yml metadata/com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks.yml`
4. Commit and push: `git add metadata/com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks.yml && git commit -m "New App: com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks" && git push -u origin com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks`
5. Open a [Merge Request](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/new)

## Upstream metadata

The app repository includes F-Droid-compatible metadata (Fastlane structure). `metadata/` at repo root mirrors `fdroid/metadata/com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks/` so F-Droid finds it when building:

- `metadata/en-US/short_description.txt` (Fastlane; F-Droid accepts this from app repo)
- `metadata/en-US/full_description.txt` (Fastlane; F-Droid accepts this from app repo)
- `metadata/en-US/images/icon.png` (512x512)
- `metadata/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/1.png`, `2.png`, `3.png` (Light, Dark, Settings)
- `metadata/en-US/changelogs/{versionCode}.txt`

Screenshots are generated by `./scripts/generate-screenshots.sh` and copied to both `flatpak/screenshots/` and `fdroid/.../phoneScreenshots/`. F-Droid requires at least one screenshot for the Latest tab.

## Flutter build config (do not change)

F-Droid reviewer (linsui) requires extracting the Flutter version from the repo, not hardcoding it. Use `flutter@stable` in srclibs and prebuild steps that read from `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Do **not** replace with `flutter@3.41.1` or similar.

## Reproducible builds and signer verification

This project uses the F-Droid upstream-signed APK verification path:

- `AllowedAPKSigningKeys` pins the expected SHA256 certificate fingerprint.
- `Builds.binary` points to the upstream release APK URL.
- `UpdateCheckMode: Tags ^v[0-9.]+$` filters pre-release tags for submit metadata.

CI workflow `F-Droid Validate` performs a reproducibility preflight:

- checks stable-only submit metadata
- validates deterministic metadata settings for the current build
- downloads upstream APK and verifies signer fingerprint against `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`
- runs `scripts/fdroid-repro-proof.sh` to compare `lib/arm64-v8a/libapp.so` hash between a local `buildserver-trixie` container build and the upstream release APK
- uploads verification logs as workflow artifacts

Trigger behavior is serialized with release flow:

- `F-Droid Validate` auto-runs only after a successful `Build & Release` workflow run (via `workflow_run`)
- manual fallback remains available through `workflow_dispatch`
- metadata-only pushes no longer auto-start `F-Droid Validate`

`libapp.so` for Flutter contains absolute build paths. To avoid path-based drift, all release paths are aligned to `/tmp/build`:

- GitHub Actions `build-android` job copies the workspace to `/tmp/build` and runs `flutter build apk` there
- F-Droid metadata (`prebuild` and `build`) moves `com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks` to `/tmp/build` during the build and moves it back afterward
- `scripts/fdroid-repro-proof.sh` clones and builds in `/tmp/build`

Container troubleshooting note:

- If `verify-libapp-reproducibility` fails early with `fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/repo/.git'` (exit 128), ensure the proof script configures `git safe.directory` for `/repo` and `/repo/.git` before clone and uses `git clone --no-local file:///repo /tmp/build`.

Important transition note: older tags built before this alignment (for example existing `v0.3.3`) can still fail the `libapp.so` proof against newly aligned local builds. Reproducibility validation should be treated as authoritative for the next tag built with the aligned `/tmp/build` pipeline.

## Fixing CI: check apk (Dependency metadata)

If the F-Droid CI fails with `ERROR Found extra signing block 'Dependency metadata'`, the app's `android/app/build.gradle` must include `dependenciesInfo { includeInApk = false }` in the `android` block. This disables the AGP dependency metadata block that F-Droid's scanner rejects. A new release (commit) with this fix is required before re-submitting.

## Fixing CI: check-localized-metadata

If the F-Droid CI fails with "should use fdroid name summary.txt/description.txt", the metadata folder must not be in fdroiddata. Metadata comes from the app repo. In your fdroiddata fork, on branch `com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks`:

```bash
cd ~/fdroiddata  # or your fdroiddata clone
git checkout com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks
rm -rf metadata/com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks
git add metadata/
git commit -m "Remove localized metadata (use app repo)"
git push origin com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks
```
