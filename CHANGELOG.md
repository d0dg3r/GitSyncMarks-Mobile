# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Release types:** Tags without suffix (e.g. `v0.3.0`) create stable releases marked as "latest". Tags with suffix (e.g. `v0.3.0-beta.1`, `v0.3.0-rc.1`, `v0.3.0-test.1`) create pre-releases; all platforms are built in both cases.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Android release signing policy:** `release` builds now require valid `android/key.properties` and no longer fall back to debug signing
- **Release workflow signing order:** CI now configures Android signing before building APK/AAB and verifies APK signer fingerprint against the configured keystore
- **Release workflow split for reproducibility:** Android build now runs in F-Droid `buildserver-trixie` container (`build-android`), while Linux desktop build runs separately in `build-linux`
- **F-Droid submit strategy:** Metadata now starts from current stable release only and uses upstream APK verification (`Builds.binary` + `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`) for channel-compatible updates
- **Release SOP:** Added mandatory release order and hard stop gates (version/code/tag/hash checks) across GitHub and F-Droid flows
- **F-Droid submit automation:** `submit-to-gitlab.sh` now supports `--validate-only` and writes proof logs under `fdroid/proofs/`

### Fixed

- **F-Droid rewritemeta compliance:** Removed inline comments from app metadata build entries so F-Droid `rewritemeta` formatting check passes for `com.d0dg3r.gitsyncmarks`
- **F-Droid reproducibility preflight:** Added CI validation that checks deterministic submit metadata settings and verifies upstream APK signer fingerprints with uploaded verification logs
- **Release CI keystore path:** Build workflow now writes and verifies the Android upload keystore at `android/upload-keystore.jks` to match Gradle `storeFile` resolution
- **Release CI signer check:** Keystore SHA256 normalization now strips `:` so APK and keytool fingerprints are compared in the same format
- **F-Droid validate parser:** Reproducibility workflow now accepts variant `apksigner` SHA-256 output formats when extracting signer fingerprints
- **Release reproducibility env:** Tagged build jobs now export `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` from the tagged commit timestamp to improve deterministic Flutter/Android outputs across CI systems
- **F-Droid build reproducibility env:** Metadata build step now also exports `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` from the source commit timestamp so F-Droid and GitHub builds use the same deterministic epoch input
- **Containerized Android CI bootstrap:** Release workflow now installs `jq` in the F-Droid build container before running `subosito/flutter-action`
- **Containerized Flutter extraction prerequisites:** Release workflow now installs `xz-utils` (plus `zip`/`unzip`) so Flutter SDK `.tar.xz` extraction works in the F-Droid build container
- **Containerized Flutter git safety fix:** Android container job now normalizes ownership of `$FLUTTER_ROOT` after setup to avoid `git dubious ownership` failures during `flutter pub get`
- **Containerized Android SDK discovery:** Android container job now auto-detects SDK path (`ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) in the F-Droid build image before APK build
- **Android container Gradle stability:** Disabled Gradle cache restore in the containerized Android release job to avoid corrupted file-access journal cache failures
- **Android container Gradle home isolation:** Android release job now isolates `GRADLE_USER_HOME` from host/global caches inside the container environment
- **Android container Gradle env pinning:** `GRADLE_USER_HOME` is now exported from `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` at runtime and `GRADLE_OPTS` disables VFS file watching
- **Android container Gradle journal reset:** Release job now removes `journal-1` and `file-access.bin` artifacts before APK build to prevent bootstrap journal parse crashes
- **Android container Gradle tmp-home:** `GRADLE_USER_HOME` now points to `/tmp/gradle-user-home` to avoid workspace mount side effects on Gradle access-time journal parsing
- **Android container Gradle deep clean:** Release job now also clears project-level Gradle caches (`.gradle`, `android/.gradle`) and enables `org.gradle.daemon=false` for deterministic cold startup
- **Android release debug verbosity:** APK build step now runs with `--verbose` to capture full Gradle diagnostics during CI failure triage
- **Android container locale pinning:** Release job now exports `LANG/LC_ALL/LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8` to prevent empty Java `user.country` values that break Gradle file-access journal initialization
- **Android deterministic timestamp fix:** Container prerequisites now include `git`, and `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` export now fails fast unless a valid commit timestamp is resolved (prevents empty-value Gradle/Java 21 crashes)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Base path folder browser:** GitHub connection now includes a folder browser to select the repository base path instead of typing paths manually
- **Settings sync client name flow:** Individual mode now supports explicit client names and a “Create my client setting” action
- **Custom sync interval input:** Sync profile `Custom` now provides a minutes input (1-1440) with validation
- **Sync profile guidance:** Sync tab now explains what each profile interval means (real-time, frequent, normal, power save, custom)
- **Secret field visibility toggle:** Token and password inputs now include an eye button to show/hide sensitive values on demand
- **App language setting:** Added a new `General` settings tab with app language selection (`System`, `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`)
- **App theme setting:** Added theme selection in `Settings > General` with `System`, `Light`, and `Dark`
- **Full 12-language localization:** All UI strings translated into all 12 supported languages (`en`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `pt_BR`, `pt`, `it`, `ja`, `zh_CN`, `zh`, `ko`, `ru`, `tr`, `pl`); Traditional Chinese added as bonus locale

### Changed

- **Settings sync storage path:** Individual mode now writes to `profiles/<alias>/settings.enc` (extension-compatible); legacy `settings.enc` and `settings-*.enc` remain readable
- **Settings sync UX parity:** Import/load/create actions in individual mode are gated by client name and successful actions persist the password for future sync operations
- **Bookmark metadata handling:** Bookmark write operations now ensure `_index.json` exists with `{ "version": 2 }`
- **GitHub settings tabs:** Added dedicated `Folders` subtab under GitHub; root-folder selection and displayed-folder filters were moved out of `Connection`
- **Sync status metadata:** The bookmark status area now shows the short Git commit hash for the last successful sync
- **Settings sync mode migration:** Global mode is now disabled in-app; stored/global mode values are migrated to individual mode while legacy global files remain readable as fallback
- **Settings tab spacing:** Reduced horizontal spacing between tab labels in main and sub-tab menus for a denser layout
- **Settings tab alignment:** Main settings tab row now starts left with a small inset so `GitHub` does not touch the screen edge

### Fixed

- **Profiles folder hidden from bookmarks UI:** Internal settings-sync directory `profiles/` is no longer shown as a bookmark root folder in Test Connection and folder lists
- **Theme setting localization parity:** `Settings > General` theme labels (`System`, `Light`, `Dark`) are now translated in all supported app locales
- **F-Droid:** 0.3.2 build commit in submit metadata now matches v0.3.2 tag (`715e5e2`); was `cecdde3` (wrong commit)
- **F-Droid check apk:** Removed version 0.3.1 (versionCode 8) from build list – APK contained "Dependency metadata" signing block (fix only in 0.3.2); CI now passes

- **Pre-1.0 beta disclaimer:** Add status notice to README, store descriptions (F-Droid, Play Store), Flatpak metainfo, and docs; Android marked as Beta; all platforms best-effort before 1.0
- **Flatpak app ID:** GitSyncMarksMobile → GitSyncMarksApp (`io.github.d0dg3r.GitSyncMarksApp`); existing Flatpak users must uninstall the old app and install the new one
- **F-Droid submit script:** Branch-Update mit Merge (erhält Remote-Änderungen); `--force` für Force-Push; README-Pfad und Build 0.3.1 korrigiert
- **Release workflow:** Fix `secrets` context in `if` conditions (use run-step output instead)
- **F-Droid:** Release workflow documented in fdroid/README.md; metadata uses commit hashes (tags not fetched in F-Droid shallow clone); rewritemeta-compatible (no comments, chronological builds); UpdateCheckMode regex `^v[0-9.]+$` filters pre-releases

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **F-Droid check apk:** `dependenciesInfo.includeInApk = false` – verhindert "extra signing block 'Dependency metadata'" im F-Droid CI

---

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Beta testing signup:** README banner and [BETA_JOIN.md](BETA_JOIN.md) for Google Play Store launch; Issue template for structured signups
- **Play Store preparation:** AAB build, upload key signing (`android/key.properties`), CI support via GitHub secrets; see [store/README.md](store/README.md)
- **Cursor MDC rules:** release-workflow, platform-gotchas; extended docs-sync, release-checklist, fdroid-maintenance, project-context
- **AGENTS.md:** Central AI agent guidance for Cursor sessions

### Changed

- **Repository rename:** GitSyncMarks-Mobile → GitSyncMarks-App (https://github.com/d0dg3r/GitSyncMarks-App)

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Settings Sync to Git** (extension-compatible): Encrypted settings sync (global/individual mode), Push/Pull, Import from other device
- **Move bookmarks to folder**: Long-press on bookmark → "In Ordner verschieben" with hierarchical folder picker (including subfolders)
- **Reorder bookmarks**: Drag-and-drop to reorder in root folders and subfolders; changes persisted to `_order.json`
- **Share link as bookmark**: Receive shared URLs (e.g. from Chrome) and add as bookmark
- **Recursive folder display**: Subfolders and nested bookmarks now displayed correctly
- **Password-protected export/import**: Settings export encrypted with AES-256-GCM; import prompts for password when encrypted file detected
- **Configurable root folder**: Select any folder as "root" for tab navigation; its subfolders become tabs
- **Auto-lock edit mode**: Edit mode (reorder/move) auto-locks after 60 seconds of inactivity; any edit action resets the timer
- **Delete bookmarks**: Long-press on any bookmark to delete (available even when edit mode is locked)
- **Post-import auto-sync**: After importing settings, bookmarks sync automatically if credentials are valid
- **Reset all data**: Button in About tab to clear all profiles, settings, and cached data
- **Import on empty state**: "Import Settings" button shown when no credentials are configured
- **Default profile creation**: Default profile is automatically created on first launch or when saving credentials
- **Pre-release CI tags**: Tags with `-beta`, `-rc`, `-test` etc. build all platforms but create pre-releases instead of latest releases
- **Workflow "Flatpak test":** Isolated Flatpak build via `workflow_dispatch` or tag `v*-flatpak-test*` (no full release)

### Changed

- **Flatpak icon:** Fallback to `flutter_assets/assets/images/app_icon.png` when standard path missing
- Settings Sync UI aligned with Chrome extension: main toggle, sync mode (Global/Individual), Save password, Import from other device
- Status (last sync, bookmark count) moved above search bar
- Removed redundant blue "Sync now" button (Sync icon in AppBar remains)
- Extension-compatible encryption (`gitsyncmarks-enc:v1`) for settings.enc
- Edit mode defaults to locked on every app launch
- Edit mode toggle moved to AppBar (lock/unlock icon)
- Desktop export uses `FilePicker.saveFile()` instead of `Share.shareXFiles()` (Linux/Windows/macOS)
- Golden tests with `golden_toolkit` for proper font rendering in screenshots
- F-Droid metadata with screenshots, icon, changelogs

### Fixed

- **Flatpak CI:** Prepare step finds Linux bundle tar.gz after download-artifact (path fix)
- **Flatpak build:** Tar extraction uses `--no-same-owner`; creation uses `--owner=root --group=root` to avoid ownership errors
- Folder picker for move: Unterordner des Quellordners werden angezeigt (vorher ausgefiltert)
- Infinite height layout error in ReorderableListView
- Debug instrumentation removed
- Profile dropdown overflow in AppBar (Flexible text with ellipsis)
- Infinite sync loop when importing settings (replaceProfiles with triggerSync guard)
- "Bad state: No element" crash when exporting with no profiles
- `allowMoveReorder` now always defaults to false (not persisted)
