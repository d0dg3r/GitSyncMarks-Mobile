## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Settings Sync to Git** (extension-compatible): Encrypted settings sync (global/individual mode), Push/Pull, Import from other device
- **Move bookmarks to folder**: Long-press on bookmark → "In Ordner verschieben" with hierarchical folder picker (including subfolders)
- **Reorder bookmarks**: Drag-and-drop to reorder in root folders and subfolders; changes persisted to `_order.json`
- **Share link as bookmark**: Receive shared URLs (e.g. from Chrome) and add as bookmark
- **Recursive folder display**: Subfolders and nested bookmarks now displayed correctly
- **Workflow "Flatpak test":** Isolated Flatpak build via `workflow_dispatch` or tag `v*-flatpak-test*` (no full release)

### Changed

- **Flatpak icon:** Fallback to `flutter_assets/assets/images/app_icon.png` when standard path missing
- Settings Sync UI aligned with Chrome extension: main toggle, sync mode (Global/Individual), Save password, Import from other device
- Status (last sync, bookmark count) moved above search bar
- Removed redundant blue "Sync now" button (Sync icon in AppBar remains)
- Extension-compatible encryption (`gitsyncmarks-enc:v1`) for settings.enc

### Fixed

- **Flatpak CI:** Prepare step finds Linux bundle tar.gz after download-artifact (path fix)
- **Flatpak build:** Tar extraction uses `--no-same-owner`; creation uses `--owner=root --group=root` to avoid ownership errors
- Folder picker for move: Unterordner des Quellordners werden angezeigt (vorher ausgefiltert)
- Infinite height layout error in ReorderableListView
- Debug instrumentation removed
