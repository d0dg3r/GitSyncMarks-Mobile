# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Release types:** Tags without suffix (e.g. `v0.3.0`) create stable releases marked as "latest". Tags with suffix (e.g. `v0.3.0-beta.1`, `v0.3.0-rc.1`, `v0.3.0-test.1`) create pre-releases; all platforms are built in both cases.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Settings Sync to Git** (extension-compatible): Encrypted settings sync (global/individual mode), Push/Pull, Import from other device
- **Move bookmarks to folder**: Long-press on bookmark → "In Ordner verschieben" with hierarchical folder picker (including subfolders)
- **Reorder bookmarks**: Drag-and-drop to reorder in root folders and subfolders; changes persisted to `_order.json`
- **Share link as bookmark**: Receive shared URLs (e.g. from Chrome) and add as bookmark
- **Recursive folder display**: Subfolders and nested bookmarks now displayed correctly
- **Password-protected export/import**: Settings export encrypted with AES-256-GCM; import prompts for password when encrypted file detected
- **Configurable root folder**: Select any folder as "root" for tab navigation; its subfolders become tabs
- **Auto-lock edit mode**: Edit mode (reorder/move) auto-locks after 60 seconds of inactivity; any edit action resets the timer
- **Delete bookmarks**: Long-press on any bookmark to delete (available even when edit mode is locked)
- **Post-import auto-sync**: After importing settings, bookmarks sync automatically if credentials are valid
- **Reset all data**: Button in About tab to clear all profiles, settings, and cached data
- **Import on empty state**: "Import Settings" button shown when no credentials are configured
- **Default profile creation**: Default profile is automatically created on first launch or when saving credentials
- **Pre-release CI tags**: Tags with `-beta`, `-rc`, `-test` etc. build all platforms but create pre-releases instead of latest releases
- **Workflow "Flatpak test":** Isolated Flatpak build via `workflow_dispatch` or tag `v*-flatpak-test*` (no full release)

### Changed

- **Flatpak icon:** Fallback to `flutter_assets/assets/images/app_icon.png` when standard path missing
- Settings Sync UI aligned with Chrome extension: main toggle, sync mode (Global/Individual), Save password, Import from other device
- Status (last sync, bookmark count) moved above search bar
- Removed redundant blue "Sync now" button (Sync icon in AppBar remains)
- Extension-compatible encryption (`gitsyncmarks-enc:v1`) for settings.enc
- Edit mode defaults to locked on every app launch
- Edit mode toggle moved to AppBar (lock/unlock icon)
- Desktop export uses `FilePicker.saveFile()` instead of `Share.shareXFiles()` (Linux/Windows/macOS)
- Golden tests with `golden_toolkit` for proper font rendering in screenshots
- F-Droid metadata with screenshots, icon, changelogs

### Fixed

- **Flatpak CI:** Prepare step finds Linux bundle tar.gz after download-artifact (path fix)
- **Flatpak build:** Tar extraction uses `--no-same-owner`; creation uses `--owner=root --group=root` to avoid ownership errors
- Folder picker for move: Unterordner des Quellordners werden angezeigt (vorher ausgefiltert)
- Infinite height layout error in ReorderableListView
- Debug instrumentation removed
- Profile dropdown overflow in AppBar (Flexible text with ellipsis)
- Infinite sync loop when importing settings (replaceProfiles with triggerSync guard)
- "Bad state: No element" crash when exporting with no profiles
- `allowMoveReorder` now always defaults to false (not persisted)
